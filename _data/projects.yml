   description: gender disparities in plays/scripts
   brief: crunch-shake initially came from my desire to create an automated way to test if a script/play passed the bechdel test. Eventually I expanded the tool set to include other tests, like determining which vocabulary was favoured by females versus males.

   description: the harbinger of the ti-84's death
   brief: I know there's people who love their ti-84's-it might have been the first computer they had access to and could program on-but I personally find it to be a overprices piece of junk. Unfortunately there aren't any actually good multiline calculators online, so this is might attempt at writing one.

 - title: complex-sets
   description: Julia and Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets, oh my! 
   brief: Just a project I picked up to learn Haskell. Right now you have to change the source code to view a different portion of a set, hopefully I'll find time to make this feature available in the app itself.
