Hello, my name is Zhiyan Foo. I am a conscript in the Singapore's Army who
prefers doing math and programming to grunt work. 

# What do you do in your free time?
When get time off from the Army, I like doing online courses, you can read more
here. Other than that I like basketball and soccer and live music. 

# Why should I hire you?
If the work is interesting (mathy) and I'm learning, I'll invest a lot of
myself in it.
