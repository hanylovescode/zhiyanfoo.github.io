Hello, my name is Zhiyan Foo. I am currently a conscript in the Army (Singapore). 

# What do you do in your free time?
When I get time off from the Army, I study math and program. Mostly I do online
courses and coming up with projects to do -- some which I publish on github.
Other than I like basketball/soccer, novels and live music. 

# Why should I hire you? :necktie: 
If the work is interesting (mathy) and I'm learning, I'll invest a lot of
myself into it. However in this case, the converse is also true. Check out my
[resume here]({{ site.url }}/assets/doc/resume.pdf).

# How should I contact you?
