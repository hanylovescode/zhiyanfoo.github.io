Hello, my name is Zhiyan Foo. I am a conscript in the Army (Singapore) who
prefers doing math and programming to grunt work. 

# What do you do in your free time?
When I get time off from the Army :pray:, I like doing online courses. Other
than I like basketball, soccer, and live music. 

# Why should I hire you? :necktie: 
If the work is interesting (mathy) and I'm learning, I'll invest a lot of
myself into it. Beware however, the converse is also true.
