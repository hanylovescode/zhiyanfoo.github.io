---
Hello, my name is Zhiyan Foo. I'm a math undergrad at university of waterloo.

<!---
# What do you do in your free time?
I spend a lot of my time  doing online courses -- mostly related to math and
computer science, but also on the humanities e.g. modern poetry. I also
like to work on coding projects -- some which I publish on github.  Other than
I like basketball/soccer, novels and live music.

# Why should I hire you? :necktie: 
If the work is interesting (mathy) and I'm learning, I'll invest a lot of
myself into it. However in this case, the converse is also true. Check out my
[resume here]({{ site.url }}/assets/doc/resume.pdf).
