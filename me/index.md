Hello, my name is Zhiyan Foo. I'm a math undergrad at university of waterloo.

# What do you do in your free time?
Before coming to university of waterloo I spend a lot of my time doing online
courses -- mostly related to math and computer science, but also on the
humanities e.g. modern poetry. Now I have more then enough coursework, so to
relax I play billiards and dungeons and dragons with friends. I still work on
side projects -- some which I publish on github.  Other than that I like
basketball/soccer, novels and live music.

# Why should I hire you? :necktie: 
If the work is interesting (mathy) and I'm learning, I'll invest a lot of
myself into it. However in this case, the converse is also true. Check out my
[resume here]({{ site.url }}/assets/doc/resume.pdf).
