Over the last two years I've spent over a 1000 hours studying mathematics,
computer science and working on coding projects. These are six things I've
learnt. 

But before we get into that though… 

# Why I spent two years taking online courses.

It wasn't by choice. As a Singaporean male, I had to serve two years in the
military -- when I first enlisted though, I failed my medical: the doctors had
discovered a cyst in my brain. So I ended up as an army clerk. Since I wasn't
going to get the traditional army experience, I decided to take this
opportunity to study the subjects that fascinated me: programming and math.
Most of the time all I had access to was pen and paper, so that's what I used. 

# Rule #1: Don’t study from home, join a coworking space.

Let’s face it. Studying can be hard, and all of us are tempted to slack off by
turning to facebook or worst of all, starting a netflix binge. The best way to
avoid this is by designating a space (outside of your house) where you do
nothing but study<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. My brother does his studying at our local library, but I
prefer going to a local coworking space on the weekends. It’s called
Hackerspace.sg. 

Google *co-working space in (where you live)* and just join one now. Pro-tip:
even if you’re not a programmer, most hackerspaces welcome new (paying) members
especially if you have some technical interest or just love of learning. 

# Rule #2: Don’t take dumbed down courses.

Let’s say you want to learn about machine learning. What of the three options
below do you take?  

<ol type="A">
  <li><a href="https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html">Caltech’s <em>Learning
  from Data</em></a>:
  A course taken by Caltech students but designed such that it can also can be
  self-studied online.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Stanford’s <em>Machine Learning</em></a>: A coursera course that takes selected topics
  from Stanford’s CS 229 course and presents them for those without a strong
  mathematical background.
  </li>
  <li>Who need’s to take a course? Just download the
  material from <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/">CS 229</a> and do them.
  </li>
</ol>

I would go with option A (in fact I did take Caltech’s course), followed by
option C and finally take option B. Whenever possible do the same course that
students in the university are doing. If the professor doesn't let their own
students take the course (or something very similar) for credits, proceed with
caution. The reason why option A is preferable for option C, is that often
times there would be missing material if the content posted online is meant for
only Stanford students and not the general public e.g. no exam solutions, or
the occasional missing lecture video.

# Rule #3: Learn with others whenever possible.

Learning with other people serves two purposes. First it’s an opportunity to
test out your knowledge. It’s easy to fool yourself that you know something;
it’s harder to fool other people. Second, it’s a lot more fun to learn with
someone else.  Personally I joined a programming book club; check out
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for similar interest groups. Often popular courses in big cities
will have a meetups by people taking that course. 

Here are some other resources to connect with other people while learning.

[Pramp](https://pramp.com/): A website where developers can take turns giving
each other mock technical interviews. Even if you're not applying for a job,
it’s good practice to solve algorithm problem. Plus it’s free.

[The exchanges](http://stackexchange.com/sites#). I use the tech focused ones
e.g. [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [math stack exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/) and [code review exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/) -- these tend
to be the most active. But there's over a 50 including one on [Japanese
language acquisition](http://japanese.stackexchange.com/) and another on
[parenting](http://parenting.stackexchange.com/).

Other resources to connect with people online (from when I was learning
Japanese).


* [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/) : Write a piece -- a diary entry or an essay
  -- in the language you are trying to learn.  Get it corrected by native
  speakers of the language. Reciprocate by helping others correct their work in
  a language you are fluent in.

* [italki](https://www.italki.com/home) : "Connect with online teachers and
  native-speaking language partners."


# Rule #4: Print whenever possible.

Not the most environmentally-friendly of rules, but I find it easier to
concentrate when working with printed material as opposed to staring at a
computer screen. Also you aren't as tempted to check your email or surf the
web. Buy a printer that has cheap ink cartridges or get friendly with your
neighbourhood print shop owner. If you’re doing a course on coursera, you can
still print out their quizzes – the formatting gets a bit off, but it’s still
usable.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> 

# Rule #5: Summarize what you learnt from a lecture after watching it.  

Watching lectures does not equal learning. I generally do not take notes while
watching lectures, I prefer focusing on understanding what the lecturer is
saying. But I do jot down the key ideas in the lecture and then at the end of
it, try to explain to myself what those concepts are. If my there are gaps in
my knowledge, I re-watch the portion of the video that address these gaps. 


# Rule #6: Every piece of work you do must have a feedback mechanism.

One enjoyable aspect of studying on your own, is that you don’t have to worry
about grades or exams. Yet at the same time, this is the curse of online
learning, the lack of rigorous feedback. Getting a C- on a paper maybe
disheartening, but it provides impetus for getting better, it identifies areas
that needs improving and prepares you for the challenges that you would face in
the real world.

In mathematics and computer science, it's not difficult to give yourself an
education comparable to that of a undergraduate major in those respective
fields, precisely because the answers to problems in this field are clear-cut.
There's always a right and wrong answer.<sup><a href="#fn3"
id="ref3">3</a></sup> 

But in literature or in the humanities, you need another person to critically
evaluate your work, and so it's much harder to progress in these fields alone.
The best substitute I've found are the $1400 dollar courses you can take
through the continued education programmes of universities like Harvard and
Stanford. You get your essays and whatnot graded by X prestigious college TA’s
-- if not their professors. If you're a precocious high school student, you
might look into these during the summer holidays, but the cost of these courses
is so high, you're better of just going to college if you plan to do this long
term.

Even if you’re just studying technical problems, it’s helpful to take at least
one course with human feedback. For example, I did Harvard’s [Real Analysis,
Convexity and
Optimization](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/real-analysis-convexity-optimization/14806?_ga=1.130979788.2392206533.1464935770)
course, which has multivariable calculus and linear
algebra as prerequisites -– meaning I could test my understanding of these
subjects I self-learnt by taking the course.

# What education means to me.

When I first came across the courses that MIT, Harvard and other universities
had put up on iTunes, I was amazed. I was afraid that universities had made a
mistake and that they would take the course down at any moment -- so I began
downloading as many courses as I could. One of the courses I added to my
archives was MIT's computer science course. I didn't know what computer science
was, but I knew 'computer' and 'science' were two of my favorite things. That's
how I got into programming and I haven't stopped since then. 

But it was when I got into the army is when these courses became a significant
part of my life, and I'm grateful for the universities that put them up.
Particularly MIT though, it's one thing to put up your best courses online --
which is what other univerisites have done, it is another to systematically
put all your content online up for scrutiny.

<sup id="fn1">1. I learnt this lesson inadvertently while in the army. As you
can imagine, there were very little distractions in the office I was assigned
to in the army – most of the computers had no internet access – so I was always
either doing my work or studying at my desk. <a href="#ref1"

is complete without exposure to experimentation -- impossible to get outside of
a university setting. <a href="#ref3"
