**TL;DR** Finally an easy course from MIT.

# What is this?
A first year course in differential equation. Many models in the natural
sciences come in the form of differential equations, so this course is of
particular interest to science or engineering majors.

# Should I take it?

Overall this course was much easier than the two previous courses I took from
MIT, and so a nice change of pace. There some strange bits to the course, like
the convulsion methods for solving equations.  And Fourier series, like many
infinite series, are a pain in the ass to work with. But the core material is
straightforward enough that you can probably skip a bulk of the video lectures
if you understand what's in the lecture notes. The most interesting material
comes from the equations you can't solve. You then have to turn to other
methods to get a feel for the system these equations represent. These
visualization methods are a direct contrast to the analytical methods for
solving differential equations, which basically all seem like one-off tricks.
Really the main takeaway from this course is not how to solve differential
equations, which you'll be doing with software like Mathematica and Matlab
anyway, but how to view differential equations. This will also likely be the
first contact you have with chaos theory which is cool. If your interested in
the natural sciences, taking a course on differential equations at this level
is a good idea, and this course in particular presents the material really
well. For mathematicians or computer scientists though, this isn't an essential
course.

# Additional Resources/Tips
The lecture videos and the lecture notes/problems don't always align,
especially in the beginning. The early stuff is easy enough that I recommend
you just focus on the notes. Only if you get really stuck on a particular
section do I recommend you then turn to the videos.
