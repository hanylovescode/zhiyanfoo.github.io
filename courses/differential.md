title: Differential Equations
---

**TL;DR** A math course for scientists. 

# What is this?
A first year course in differential equation. Topics include first order
differential equations, second order constant coefficient linear equations,
fourier series and the laplace transform, as well as first order systems.

# Should I take it?

Many models in the natural sciences come in the form of differential equations,
so this course is of particular interest to science or engineering majors. If
your interests lie in pure math or computer science though, this isn't an
essential course.

# What excited you about this course?

The most interesting material comes from the equations you can't solve. You
then have to turn to other methods to get a feel for the system these equations
represent. These visualization methods are a direct contrast to the analytical
methods for solving differential equations, which basically all seem like
one-off tricks. 

Really the main takeaway from this course is not how to solve
differential equations, which you'll be doing with software like Mathematica
and Matlab anyway, but how to view differential equations. 

This will also likely be the first contact you have with chaos theory which is
cool. 

# Additional Resources/Tips

The lecture videos and the lecture notes/problems don't always align,
especially in the beginning. The early stuff is easy enough that I recommend
you just focus on the notes. Only if you get really stuck on a particular
section do I recommend you then turn to the videos.

differential systems).
