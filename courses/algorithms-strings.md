title: Algorithms on Strings
---

**TL;DR** Far more interesting that algorithms on graphs.

# What is this?

This course covers a variety of algorithms related to compressing and pattern
matching strings.  In particular there's a focus on algorithms that allow DNA
to be sequenced efficiently.

# Should I take it?

If your interested in string algorithms, this might be your only option, there
aren't many online courses covering this topic. Overall the assignments are
much more interesting and challenging than those found in the algorithms on
graph course (also offered by USD). The presentation is a bit better too.

# What excited you about the course?

There were two standouts for me, the Burrows Wheeler Transform, which my
[programming book club](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/232947776/)
unanimously thought was very cool, and the way all the algorithms related back
to genetic sequencing.
