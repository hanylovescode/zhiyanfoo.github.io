title: Algorithms on Graphs

**TL;DR** Far more interesting that algorithms on graphs.

# What is this?

Algorithms on strings covers your a variety of algorithms related to strings,
mainly related to compression and pattern matching. In particular there's a
focus on algorithms that allow DNA to be sequenced efficiently.

# Should I take it?

Algorithms on strings is another course offered by the University of San Diego
as part of their algorithms concentration. The topics covered here are far more
interesting than their preceding graph course and the problem sets more
challenging but in a good way. The presentation is also better, which
admittedly is not saying much. There were two standouts for me, the Burrows
Wheeler Transform, which my programming book club unanimously thought was very
cool and the way all the algorithms related back to genetic sequencing.
