**TL;DR** A surprisingly difficult course on probability.

# What is this?

Its full title is 'probabilistic systems analysis and applied probability'.
Maybe if the title was just 'probability', the professor felt people wouldn't
take it seriously or something. The course focuses on "the modeling
and analysis of random phenomena and processes". Topics include, but are not
limited to, discrete and continuous random variables, derived distributions,
convolution, covariance and correlation, iterated expectations, bernoulli
process, poisson process, markov chains, weak law of large numbers, central
limit theorem, bayesian statistical inference, classical statistical inference.
I'm starting to realize why it took me so long to finish this course.

# Should I take it?

Random processes are so prevalent in the world, I figured I had to take a
course on it. Frankly though probability is not something I enjoy in of itself.
I also kind of misconstrued statistics (which focuses on the collection and
interpretation of data) with probability. This course does not touch on any
statistical ideas. That's not to take away from the course itself, it is a good
course. The textbook in particular is excellent. It does however go over a
hundred and one topics. It very much has a engineering feel to it, a lot of
interesting applied problems are scattered throughout the course, and the
course content is aimed very much at solving this problems, but there's very
little world-building if that makes sense. My favourite part of the course has
to be Markov chains which seem to be a very versatile tool.

# Additional Resources/Tips

Multivariable calculus is a pre-requisite for this course. If you love doing
double integrals, this is the course for you. Markov chains also involve a fair
bit of linear algebra. Don't let the word probability fool you, its a hard
course.
