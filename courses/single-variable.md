title: Single Variable Calculus
---

**TL;DR** Single Variable Calculus by Robert Ghrist is the best way to learn calculus. 

<h1>What is this?</h1> <p> Throughout human history, whenever a new vehicle of
expression emerges, there have been early adopters of the medium whose works
were so great, they remain among the top accomplishments in that field. When
writing first emerged there was Homer, with <em>The Odyssey</em> and <em>The
Iliad</em> (Not that I'm a particularly huge fan personally). With film there
was I don't know, Buster Keaton maybe, I'm not a silent era movie film buff.
What I do know is, Calculus: Single Variable by Robert Ghrist represents the
pinnacle of the MOOC since the MOOCs inception, and probably would remain so
for a long time.  </p>

<p> The common assumption that pervades society today is that online
lectures are a poor substitute for live teaching. But that's because most
course's lectures are just shots of a professor and blackboard in a class,
or worse, the professor talking directly into a webcam with some sort of
drawing software. prof/g's lectures on the other hand are <strong>scripted
and animated</strong> affairs. A ridiculous amount of work has gone into
his lectures and this is one of the few courses that show the true
potential of MOOCs. Imagine if Batman vs Superman's budget was instead
spent on creating animated educational course content. If the quality of
the content was at the level of this course, you would revolutionize
education from middle school to college. Maybe you could even get Ben
Affleck to do the voice work, that might get teenagers into math.  </p>

<h1>Additional Resources/Tips</h1> <p> If you've already mastered calculus
at a college level, not high school, you might consider just doing the last
section on discrete calculus (discrete calculus is almost an oxymoron).
There is some great 8-bit graphics work in the animation. But really just
do the whole course, its amazing. You also should check out the <a

that prof/g wrote. Although I rave about the video lectures, its more
important that you actually do the assignments than watch the lectures.
Almost all the problems are interesting and challenging, and will take
time.</p>
