**TL;DR** MIT's
[course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm)
is the best of its kind on the internet.

# What is this?
A first year course in multivariable calculus from MIT. It "covers
differential, integral and vector calculus for functions of more than one
variable."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Multivariable calculus is pretty much a prerequisite for any
technical field of study, except maybe (ironically) pure math. 

# Should I take it

If your looking for an introductory course to multivariable calculus, this
course is the way to go. Professor Auroux has a good feel of what material
students would find challenging and takes the time to go over those material.

While its not theory-centric, Professor Auroux always attempt, if nothing else,
a sketch of the proof for the various theorems he presents. But they can be
well&hellip; sketchy at times. The problem sets don't test knowledge of the
proofs, which I felt could have been added to solidify our understanding. All
the theorems have a strong intuitive appeal though.


# Additional Resources/Tips

I didn't find the explanation of Lagrange multipliers by the course to be
particularly helpful so I've here's a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOw7TWueU_A) that does it much better.

It's interesting how Lagrange Multipliers, a crazy useful technique in
optimization problems, is introduced in Caltech's Machine Learning course in a
completely different guise and takes on machine learning characteristics (It's
in the regularization section). Constrained optimization problems are
everywhere, but its interesting how this problems are tackled in real life,
where thousands of equations define a system instead of the four we commonly
find in practice problems.

If you have trouble with the problems that require you to change the
variables of integration, don't worry, I was there. A lot of the 3-d
integration problems just require practice to get a feel of how to set the
bounds of integration. The recitation videos become pretty helpful.
