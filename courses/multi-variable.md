**TL;DR** MIT's 
[multivariable calculus course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm)
is a very strong offering.

# What is this?
A first year course in multivariable calculus from MIT. It "covers
differential, integral and vector calculus for functions of more than one
variable." Multivariable calculus is pretty much a pre-requisite for any
technical field of study, except maybe (ironically) pure math. 

# Should I take it
If your looking for a introduction to multivariable calculus, this course
is the way to go. The only thing this course is lacking in, is rigorous proofs for
the theorems we learn in class, but this is by design. If your looking for a
theory centric course, look elsewhere, but you might not an offering with the
same quality material that this course has. At least I couldn't. Very nobly,
Professor Denis Auroux always attempt if nothing else, a sketch of a proof, but
they can be well...  sketchy at times.  The course never asks any questions
associated with the theory behind theorems which I felt could have been added
to solidify our understanding of why the theorems are true. All the theorems
have a strong intuitive appeal though.

# Additional Resources/Tips
I didn't find the explanation of Lagrange multipliers by the course to be
particularly helpful so I've here's a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOw7TWueU_A">video</a> that does it much
better. It's interesting how Lagrange Multipliers, a crazy useful technique in
optimization problems, is introduced in Caltech's Machine Learning course, in a
completely different guise and takes on machine learning characteristics (It's
in the regularization section). Constrained optimization problems are
everywhere, but its interesting how this problems are tackled in real life,
where thousands of equations define a system instead of the four we commonly
find in practice problems.

If you have trouble with the problems that require you to change the
variables of integration, don't worry, I was there. A lot of the 3-d
integration problems just require practice to get a feel of how to set the
bounds of integration. The recitation videos become pretty helpful.
