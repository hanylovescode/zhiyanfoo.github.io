**TL;DR** MIT provides a good non-theoretical take on linear algebra.

# What is this?
A first year course in linear algebra from MIT. Topics include but are not
limited to row reduction, least squares, determinants, eigenvalues, positive
definite matrices and singular value decomposition.

# Should I take it?

MIT's offering follows the conventional method of teaching linear algebra, but
the course is elevated to excellence mainly because of Professor Strang's
enthusiasm for the subject. Sometimes though he don't cover the more difficult
portions of linear algebra you might be interested in like the Fast Fourier
transform. The material isn't theory centric. 

# What's the alternative?

Well I've also audited, Brown's [Coding the
Matrix](http://codingthematrix.com/)-which covers the same material from a
computer scientists perspective-but preferred MIT's offering. In theory,
because linear algebra can be numerically intensive, teaching it in the context
of programming seems like a good idea. In practice though, especially for those
new to programming (as I was), chasing after bugs can get in the way of conceptual
understanding of the material. However take my advice with a grain of salt,
when I first took it 3 years ago, the course was just getting started and there
were kinks in the system. They've probably improved a lot since the initial
roll out of the course. 

If you have experience with programming and take Brown's course, you'll learn
linear algebra. If your new to programming however, you'll learn programming.

# Additional Resources/Tips

**Important** Don't do what I did and try finishing the problems
in the textbook. They are so many of them and a lot of them are more
computationally intensive than actually conceptually challenging. Just follow
the OCW Scholar course and check out other courses for extra exams or
assignments. The textbook is great, but the lecture notes are more concise. 

Some of the content of this course is replicated in the first portion of MIT's
multivariable course. I recommend studying this course first, at least partway,
so you an skip the first unit in the multivariable calculus course. Most people
do study both courses at the same time or do multivariable calculus first,
because its a prerequisite for so many science/engineering courses, but
conceptually linear algebra comes first.

**Fun fact:** a lot of numpy's (a numerical package for the programming language
python) algorithm implementation reference Strang's excellent
[textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0030105676)
on linear algebra.
