title: Algorithms on Graphs

**TL;DR** I'm ambivalent about this course.

# What is this?

This course covers your basic graph algorithms.

# Should I take it?

I only did it because it was what my [programming book
club](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/232102849/) chose to do next. I
enjoyed it because I did it in a group setting, which makes learning so much
more fun, but I wouldn't have picked it up by myself.

Here's the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs), you
can check out some graph generators I made for my group to debug our algorithms
[here](https://github.com/zhiyanfoo/graph_generator), but bewarned, its
rather buggy itself.
