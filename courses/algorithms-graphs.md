title: Algorithms on Graphs
---

**TL;DR** I'm ambivalent about this course.

# What is this?

Algorithms on graphs covers your basic computer science graph algorithms and
concepts.

# Should I take it?

I only did it because it was what my programming book club chose to do next. I
enjoyed it because I did it in this group setting, which makes learning so much
more fun, but I wouldn't have picked it up by myself. A lot of the video
explanations are not much better than what you'll find just by googling around.
The assignments are pretty utilitarian. There's support for a variety of
languages, although some languages are more supported than others.
