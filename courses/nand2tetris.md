**TL;DR** The most fun I had learning.

# What is this?

Nand2tetris is a project based course, where the student 'builds' (virtually) a
computer from just logic gates. If your interested you should watch the
[TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs).


# Should I take it?

The short answer is yes. You will learn a lot from it and it has the best
time-to-reward ratio of any course I've taken so far. This course, in
conjuction with Single Variable Calculus by Robert Ghirst, I believe represents
the potential of MOOC's as a result of their economies of scale. For Robert
Ghirst, it was his excellent videos. For Nand2tetris, the videos as pretty
average, its the software they built around it thats amazing. Using their tools
you can design every part of the computer from scratch, from the RAM to the
CPU, all from logic gates. It provides an invaluable insight to how such a
complex and yet important machine works. Its one of those technical courses
even a humanities major would enjoy if they had a bit of programming
background.

I did this course with my book programming club, and it was a lot of fun
discussing the ideas in this course with fellow programmers who might for
example know a lot about the linux kernel and relate it to the course material.
This is a course that is built to be done in conjunction with other people.
I've mentioned this twice already but its just a really fun course.

Here's the [course](http://nand2tetris.org/), do it.
