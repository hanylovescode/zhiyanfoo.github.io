**TL;DR** The most fun I've had learning.

# What is this?

Nand2tetris is a project based course, where the student 'builds' (virtually) a
computer from just logic gates. If your interested you should watch the
[TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs).


# Should I take it?

The short answer is yes. You will learn a lot from it and it has the best
time-to-reward ratio of any course I've taken so far. 

# What excites you about this course?

This course, in conjuction with Single Variable Calculus by Robert Ghirst,
represents the awesome potential of MOOC's as a result of their economies of
scale. For Robert Ghirst, what stood out was the amazing production quality of
his videos. For Nand2tetris, their videos are pretty average, it's the software
they built around it thats amazing.  Using their tools you can design every
part of the computer from scratch, from the RAM to the CPU, all from logic
gates. It provides an invaluable insight to how such a complex and yet
important machine works. 

# Additional Resources/Tips

This is one of those technical courses even a humanities major would enjoy if
they had a bit of programming background.

I did this course with my [book programming
club](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/231360189/), and its a lot of
fun doing this course in a group. For example there was a guy who knew a lot
about the linux kernel and related it to the course material. I've mentioned
this twice already but it's just a really fun course.
